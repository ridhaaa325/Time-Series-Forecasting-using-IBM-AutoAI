# Currency Exchange Timeseries Forecasting using IBM AutoAI

## Overview
The AutoAI graphical tool analyzes your data and uses data algorithms, transformations, and parameter settings to create the best predictive model. AutoAI displays various potential models as model candidate pipelines and rank them on a leaderboard for you to choose from. More basic AutoAI exploration for the same dataset is covered in the [Generate machine learning model pipelines to choose the best model for your problem](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/generate-machine-learning-model-pipelines-to-choose-the-best-model-for-your-problem-autoai/) article.

The objective of this analysis are:
* To find patterns from the timeseries dataset of the buying and selling exchange rate of the Dollar against the Rupiah and make predictions to determine future upward or downward trends.
* Run an AutoAI multivariate time series experiment with Supporting features.
* Constructing multiple models using AutoAI and assessing their performance.
* Selecting the optimal model and successfully deploying it.
* Generate and execute AutoAI notebook, pipelines notebook, and analyze the results.
